## ID Bridge Construction

### Bridge Table Statistics
- **Total Records**: [To be populated after execution]
- **MovieLens Coverage**: [To be populated after execution]
- **IMDb Coverage**: [To be populated after execution]
- **TMDB Coverage**: [To be populated after execution]
- **Rotten Tomatoes Coverage**: [To be populated after execution]

### Linking Strategy
- **Primary Method**: Direct ID links from MovieLens
- **Secondary Method**: Title + year fuzzy matching
- **Quality Control**: Minimum 2 source IDs required for inclusion
- **Validation**: Cross-reference consistency checks

## Data Quality Assessment

### Completeness
- **TMDB**: High completeness for popular movies, streaming data available
- **IMDb**: Very high completeness, comprehensive coverage
- **MovieLens**: High completeness for rated movies, good cross-linking
- **Rotten Tomatoes**: Medium completeness, focused on reviewed movies

### Consistency
- **Rating Scales**: Normalized across sources (IMDb: 0.5-10, RT: 0-100, ML: 0.5-5)
- **Genre Formats**: Standardized to comma-separated lists
- **Year Data**: Extracted and validated across all sources
- **Title Matching**: Fuzzy matching with manual review for ambiguous cases

### Accuracy
- **ID Links**: High accuracy for MovieLens cross-references
- **Title Matching**: Medium accuracy, requires validation
- **Metadata**: High accuracy from source systems
- **Ratings**: Preserved original scales and counts

## Data Gaps and Limitations

### Identified Gaps
1. **Streaming Availability**: Limited to TMDB data, may not cover all Netflix content
2. **Regional Coverage**: Rotten Tomatoes data primarily US-focused
3. **Language Support**: Limited multilingual title matching
4. **Recent Releases**: Some delay in data availability across sources

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **TMDB API**: Regular updates for streaming data
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Improved title cleaning algorithms
3. **Manual Review**: Queue system for ambiguous matches
4. **Data Validation**: Cross-source consistency checks
