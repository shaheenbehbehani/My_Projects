## Alert Configuration

### Alert Severity Levels

## Query Template Library

### Base Event Filters
```sql
WHERE event_date = '{event_date}'
  AND timestamp_ms >= UNIX_TIMESTAMP('{start_time}') * 1000
  AND timestamp_ms < UNIX_TIMESTAMP('{end_time}') * 1000
  AND shadow = false
  {bucket_filter}
  {cohort_filter}
  {region_filter}
```

### CTR Proxy Calculation
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(total_clicks) * 1.0 / SUM(total_impressions) as ctr_proxy,
  -- Wilson confidence interval
  (SUM(total_clicks) + 1.96 * 1.96 / 2) / (SUM(total_impressions) + 1.96 * 1.96) - 
  1.96 * SQRT((SUM(total_clicks) * (SUM(total_impressions) - SUM(total_clicks)) / SUM(total_impressions) + 1.96 * 1.96 / 4) / 
  (SUM(total_impressions) + 1.96 * 1.96)) as ctr_lower_ci
FROM analytics.daily.ctr_proxy
```

### Lift Analysis
```sql
WITH bucket_metrics AS (
  SELECT bucket, SUM(total_clicks) * 1.0 / SUM(total_impressions) as ctr
  FROM analytics.daily.ctr_proxy
  WHERE event_date = '{event_date}'
  GROUP BY bucket
)
SELECT 
  b.bucket,
  (b.ctr - c.control_ctr) / c.control_ctr as lift,
  -- Wald confidence interval
  SQRT(b.ctr * (1 - b.ctr) / b.total_impressions + 
        c.control_ctr * (1 - c.control_ctr) / c.control_impressions) as se_diff
FROM bucket_metrics b
CROSS JOIN (SELECT ctr as control_ctr FROM bucket_metrics WHERE bucket = 'control') c
WHERE b.bucket != 'control'
