# Step 3c.3 â€“ Tuning & Offline Evaluation Progress Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on Step 3c.3 â€“ Tuning & Offline Evaluation of the Movie Recommendation Optimizer pipeline, including completed work, encountered issues, and remaining tasks.

## Completed Work

### âœ… Step 3c.1 â€“ Hybrid Assembly & Alignment (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Successfully completed with all deliverables
**Files Created**:
- `data/hybrid/assembly_manifest.json` - JSON manifest with paths, shapes, dtypes, and configuration
- `data/hybrid/scoring_schema.md` - Explanation of normalization, blending, and cold-start logic
- `logs/step3c_phase1.log` - Execution log with timing and memory stats

**Key Achievements**:
- Successfully loaded content embeddings (87,601 Ã— 384) and collaborative factors (200,245 users Ã— 20, 38,963 movies Ã— 20)
- Implemented robust data structures using NumPy arrays and sparse matrices (not Python dicts/lists)
- Per-user min-max normalization of collaborative scores to [0,1] range
- Hybrid scoring formula: `score = Î±Â·content + (1âˆ’Î±)Â·collab` with Î±=0.5 default
- Cold-start handling: new users/items fall back to content-only
- Acceptance tests passed: 20 users Ã— 100 items, all scores âˆˆ [0,1], no NaN/Inf values

### âœ… Step 3c.2 â€“ Candidate Generation & Re-ranking (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Successfully completed with all deliverables
**Files Created**:
- `data/hybrid/candidates/user_1_candidates.parquet` - Test user candidate file
- `data/hybrid/rerank_manifest.json` - Configuration and execution metadata
- `logs/step3c_phase2.log` - Full execution log

**Key Achievements**:
- Two-stage candidate generation: CF seeds (N_cf_seed=800) + content expansion (M=20, k=50)
- Hard filters: genres (OR logic), providers, seen-items, safety checks
- Filter relaxation with graceful fallbacks
- Primary scoring using hybrid blend from 3c.1
- Secondary signals: quality boost (w_q=0.05), recency (w_r=0.03), provider match (w_p=0.02)
- MMR diversity control (Î»_div=0.25, K_final=50)
- Fixed KeyError: 'user_id' â†’ 'userId' in user index mapping
- Acceptance tests passed: candidate pool > 0, scores âˆˆ [0,1], no NaN/Inf, deduplicated, contiguous ranks

### ðŸ”„ Step 3c.3 â€“ Tuning & Offline Evaluation (IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: Multiple attempts made, currently implementing speed mode
**Attempts Made**:

#### Attempt 1: `step3c3_tuning_evaluation.py` (FAILED)
- **Issue**: Stalled on splitting 31.9M ratings without efficient sampling
- **Root Cause**: Attempted to process full dataset without memory-safe strategies
- **Outcome**: Script terminated after 1+ hours of processing

#### Attempt 2: `step3c3_tuning_evaluation_fast.py` (FAILED)
- **Issue**: Interrupted during execution
- **Root Cause**: Still too slow for large-scale evaluation
- **Outcome**: Script terminated before completion

#### Attempt 3: `step3c3_candidate_based_eval.py` (FAILED)
- **Issue**: "Infinite fallback cycle" during candidate generation
- **Root Cause**: Fallback logic was too permissive, causing endless retries
- **Outcome**: Script stuck in loop, manually terminated

#### Attempt 4: `step3c3_robust_evaluation.py` (INTERRUPTED)
- **Issue**: Script interrupted during stratified user sampling
- **Root Cause**: Still processing large datasets despite optimizations
- **Outcome**: Partial execution, interrupted at user sampling stage

#### Attempt 5: `step3c3_speed_mode.py` (CURRENT)
- **Status**: Currently running with speed optimizations
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Tight candidate & batch knobs: N_cf_seed=400, M=10, k=30, C_max=1200
  - Batch size: 200 users (fallback 100 if >60s)
  - Minimal metrics first pass: Recall@10, MAP@10 only
  - Hard timeouts: 6min per-Î±, 20min global
  - Candidate caching and user skipping
  - Second pass for best Î± with full metrics
- **Current Status**: Started execution, interrupted during Î±=0.35 evaluation

## Current Issues & Challenges

### 1. Performance & Scalability
- **Problem**: Large dataset (31.9M ratings, 200k users, 40k movies) causes memory and time issues
- **Impact**: Scripts stall or timeout before completion
- **Attempted Solutions**: 
  - Stratified sampling (10k â†’ 5k â†’ 2k users)
  - Per-user rating capping (max 200)
  - Batch processing (500 â†’ 200 â†’ 100 users)
  - Memory-mapped arrays
  - Candidate-based evaluation instead of full catalog

### 2. Infinite Fallback Loops
- **Problem**: Filter relaxation logic caused endless retries when candidate pools were empty
- **Impact**: Scripts stuck in infinite loops
- **Solution**: Implemented hard-stop 2-step fallback mechanism

### 3. Filter Compatibility
- **Problem**: Offline evaluation filters (genre, provider) too restrictive for historical data
- **Impact**: Empty candidate pools for many users
- **Solution**: Disabled provider filters, softened genre filters for offline evaluation

## Remaining Work

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Speed Mode Evaluation**
   - Finish running `step3c3_speed_mode.py`
   - Ensure Î± grid {0.35, 0.5, 0.65} completes within timeouts
   - Generate `data/hybrid/tuning_results.csv` with minimal metrics
   - Run second pass for best Î± with full metrics

2. **Generate Final Deliverables**
   - `data/hybrid/tuning_results.csv` - Raw grid search results
   - `docs/step3c_eval.md` - Detailed evaluation report
   - `logs/step3c_phase3.log` - Complete execution log

### ðŸ“Š Expected Deliverables
- **Tuning Results**: CSV with columns: alpha, users_eval, users_skipped, mean_cand, recall@10, map@10, alpha_time_sec, alpha_timed_out
- **Evaluation Report**: Tables with Î± grid results, baseline comparisons, slice analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Recall@K (5,10,20), MAP@10, Coverage, Novelty, Diversity
- **Acceptance Gates**: Best Î± beats baselines by â‰¥5% Recall@10, no regressions on cold-start

### ðŸ”§ Technical Optimizations Needed
1. **Further Speed Improvements**:
   - Reduce user sample size to 500-1000 users
   - Implement more aggressive candidate capping
   - Skip MMR during first pass entirely
   - Use simplified scoring functions

2. **Robustness Enhancements**:
   - Better error handling for edge cases
   - More granular progress logging
   - Checkpoint system for partial results

- `data/hybrid/candidates/user_1_candidates.parquet` - Step 3c.2 test output

## Success Criteria

- [x] Step 3c.2: Candidate generation with two-stage pipeline
- [x] Fixed data structure issues (NumPy arrays vs Python dicts)
- [x] Fixed column name issues (userId vs user_id)
- [x] Implemented fallback mechanisms

### ðŸŽ¯ In Progress
- [ ] Complete Î± grid evaluation (0.35, 0.5, 0.65)
- [ ] Generate tuning results CSV
- [ ] Create evaluation report
- [ ] Meet acceptance gates (â‰¥5% improvement over baselines)

### ðŸ“‹ Pending
- [ ] Step 3c.4 (if requested by user)
- [ ] Final pipeline integration
- [ ] Performance optimization for production

## Recommendations

1. **Continue with Speed Mode**: The current `step3c3_speed_mode.py` approach is the most promising
2. **Reduce Scope Further**: Consider evaluating only 500-1000 users for initial results
3. **Implement Checkpoints**: Save partial results to avoid losing progress
4. **Focus on Core Metrics**: Prioritize Recall@10 and MAP@10 over comprehensive evaluation
5. **Document Lessons Learned**: Capture insights about performance bottlenecks for future optimization
