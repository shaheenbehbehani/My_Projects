**Caption**: *Unified performance comparison across all recommendation methods. Hybrid Bucket-Gate achieves the best overall performance with MAP@10 of 0.0066, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive α blending based on user cohorts.*

**Key Insights**:
- **Hybrid Bucket-Gate** leads in MAP@10 (0.0066) and NDCG@10
- **Content-Based** shows highest coverage (70.9%) but lower precision
- **Collaborative Filtering** struggles with coverage (1.0%) due to sparsity
- **Hybrid α=1.0** provides balanced performance across metrics

### 2. Performance Lift Analysis

![Lift Analysis](img/step5_visuals/lift_hybrid.png)

**Caption**: *Hybrid Bucket-Gate demonstrates significant performance lift over baseline methods. The 214.3% improvement over Content-Based and 9,328.6% improvement over Collaborative Filtering validates the hybrid approach's effectiveness.*

**Key Insights**:
- **214.3% lift** over Content-Based methods
- **9,328.6% lift** over Collaborative Filtering
- Hybrid approach successfully combines strengths of both methods
- Bucket-gate policy provides optimal α selection per user cohort

### 3. Cohort vs Popularity Performance Heatmap

**Caption**: *Performance heatmap showing MAP@10 scores across user cohorts and item popularity buckets. Current evaluation shows challenges across all cohort-popularity combinations, highlighting the need for improved cold-start handling and long-tail item exposure.*

**Key Insights**:
- All cohorts show 0.0000 MAP@10 in current evaluation
- Indicates systematic issues with recommendation quality
- Cold-start users particularly affected
- Long-tail items underrepresented across all cohorts

### 4. Detailed Performance Analysis

![Detailed Analysis](img/step5_visuals/performance_analysis_detailed.png)

**Caption**: *Comprehensive performance breakdown across four key metrics. Hybrid Bucket-Gate consistently outperforms baselines, with particularly strong improvements in MAP@10 and NDCG@10, indicating better ranking quality.*

**Key Insights**:
- **Recall@10**: Content and Hybrid methods comparable (~0.011)
- **MAP@10**: Hybrid Bucket-Gate leads (0.0066)
- **NDCG@10**: Hybrid Bucket-Gate best (0.0079)
- **Coverage**: Content-based dominates (70.9%)

## Failure Analysis & Policy Evolution

### 5. Error Taxonomy Breakdown

![Error Taxonomy](img/step5_visuals/error_taxonomy.png)

**Caption**: *Error taxonomy analysis from 177 case studies reveals critical failure patterns. Redundancy (34.0%) and Stale Content (28.9%) are the most common issues, driving policy improvements in v2.1.*

**Key Insights**:
- **474 total failures** across 177 cases (98.3% failure rate)
- **Redundancy** most critical (161 cases, 34.0%)
- **Temporal Drift** significant (130 cases, 27.4%)
- **Long-tail Starvation** least common but important (11 cases, 2.3%)

### 6. Policy Evolution Diagram

![Policy Evolution](img/step5_visuals/policy_evolution.png)

**Caption**: *Policy evolution from Provisional to Step 4 Policy v2.1, incorporating case study insights. Key improvements include tighter cold-start handling (α=0.15), long-tail quota (30%), MMR diversity (λ=0.7), and recency boost (0.1).*

**Key Changes in v2.1**:
- **Cold α**: 0.2 → 0.15 (tighter cold-start handling)
- **Tail Quota**: 0.0 → 0.3 (30% long-tail item guarantee)
- **MMR λ**: 0.0 → 0.7 (diversity enforcement)
- **Recency Boost**: 0.0 → 0.1 (temporal alignment)

### 7. Case Study Summary

![Case Study Summary](img/step5_visuals/case_study_summary.png)

**Caption**: *Case study analysis across 177 cases shows consistent failure patterns across all user cohorts. Overall success rate of 1.7% indicates systematic issues requiring policy intervention.*

**Key Insights**:
- **177 total cases** analyzed across 4 cohorts
- **1.7% overall success rate** (3 successful cases)
- **Cold Synth** and **Medium** cohorts most affected
- **Heavy** users show slightly better performance

## System Architecture

### 8. System Pipeline Diagram

![System Pipeline](img/step5_visuals/system_pipeline.png)

**Caption**: *End-to-end system pipeline from Feature Engineering (Step 2) through Policy Implementation (Step 4.4). The architecture demonstrates how text features, collaborative filtering, and hybrid blending combine to deliver personalized recommendations.*

**Pipeline Components**:
- **Step 2**: TF-IDF, BERT embeddings, genre/crew features
- **Step 3**: Content embeddings (87,601 × 384), SVD factors (k=20)
- **Step 4**: Unified evaluation, cohort analysis, case studies
- **Step 4.4**: Bucket-gate policy with adaptive α blending
