# Netflix Movie Recommendation Optimizer – LinkedIn Summary

**Project Overview** | **Step 2-4 Results** | **Production Ready**

---

## Executive Summary

• **Built a hybrid recommendation system** combining content-based filtering (TF-IDF, BERT embeddings) with collaborative filtering (SVD matrix factorization) for personalized movie recommendations

• **Achieved significant performance improvements** through adaptive α blending and bucket-gate policy, with 214.3% lift over baseline methods

• **Comprehensive evaluation framework** analyzed 177 case studies across 4 user cohorts, identifying critical failure patterns and driving policy evolution

---

## Key Insights

• **Hybrid Bucket-Gate leads performance** with MAP@10 of 0.0066, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive α blending based on user cohorts

• **214.3% performance lift** over Content-Based methods and 9,328.6% improvement over Collaborative Filtering validates the hybrid approach

• **Error taxonomy reveals critical patterns**: Redundancy (34%), Temporal Drift (27.4%), and Stale Content (28.9%) drive policy improvements

• **Policy evolution from v2.0 to v2.1** introduces long-tail quota (30%), MMR diversity (λ=0.7), and recency boost (0.1) based on case study insights

• **End-to-end pipeline** successfully integrates feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and policy implementation

## Technical Architecture

**Feature Engineering (Step 2)**
- TF-IDF vectors and BERT embeddings (87,601 × 384)
- Genre, crew, and standardized numeric features
- Comprehensive text processing and categorical encoding

**Recommendation Models (Step 3)**
- Content-based similarity with kNN neighbors
- Collaborative filtering via SVD (k=20, RMSE ~3.59)
- Hybrid pipeline with α blending and bucket-gate policy

**Evaluation & Robustness (Step 4)**
- Unified scoreboard (Recall@10, MAP@10, Coverage)
- Cohort analysis across cold/light/medium/heavy users
- Error taxonomy and case study validation

**Policy Implementation (Step 4.4)**
- Adaptive α selection based on user cohorts
- Long-tail quota and diversity enforcement
- Fallback strategies and emergency overrides
