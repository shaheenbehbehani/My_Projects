## Introduction & Scope

### Problem Statement
Predict the winner of the 2025/26 Premier League season using historical match data, advanced feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

### Dataset Provenance
- **Source**: Multiple football-data.co.uk CSV files (E0.csv, E1.csv, etc.)
- **Processing**: Automated ingestion with robust date parsing and schema standardization
- **Output**: Standardized historical matches dataset with 1,140 matches across multiple seasons

### High-Level Approach
1. **Feature Store**: Elo ratings, rolling form metrics, team attributes
2. **Model Training**: XGBoost with expanding-window cross-validation
3. **Calibration**: Isotonic regression for probability calibration
4. **Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 runs) for season outcomes

### Assumptions and Constraints
- Historical performance patterns continue into 2025/26
- No major team changes (transfers, injuries) during season
- Home advantage and seasonal patterns remain consistent

---

## Data Ingestion & Standardization

### CSV Schema Handling
The `build_match_dataset.py` script implements robust CSV ingestion:

**Required Columns:**
- `Date`: Match date (multiple format support)
- `HomeTeam`: Home team name
- `AwayTeam`: Away team name  
- `FTHG`: Full-time home goals
- `FTAG`: Full-time away goals
- `FTR`: Full-time result (H/D/A)

**Date Parsing:**
- Multiple format support: DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY
- Automatic fallback to Polars inference
- Robust error handling for malformed dates

**Team Normalization:**
- Standardized team names using Phase 1 normalizer
- Consistent naming across all seasons

### Season Construction
- **Rule**: August-May season boundaries
- **Implementation**: Date-based season assignment with month threshold

### Final Standardized Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| date | Date | Match date |
| season | String | Season identifier (e.g., "2022/23") |
| home_team | String | Home team name |
| away_team | String | Away team name |
| y | String | Target variable (H/D/A) |

## Exploratory Data & Outcome Distribution

### Match Outcome Distribution

The dataset shows the following outcome distribution across all matches:

![Outcomes Distribution](outputs/figures/outcomes_distribution.png)

**Class Balance Analysis:**
- **Home Wins (H)**: 514 (45.1%)
- **Draws (D)**: 262 (23.0%)
- **Away Wins (A)**: 364 (31.9%)

The distribution shows a slight home advantage bias, which is typical in football and aligns with historical Premier League patterns.
