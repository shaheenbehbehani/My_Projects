# LA Clippers Business Insights Project

## Overview
This project analyzes retail and food & beverage transactions from multiple LA Clippers game days to uncover spending behavior, arrival patterns, and zone-based performance within the arena. The analysis supports strategic operations and fan engagement initiatives.

## Objectives
- Visualize fan arrival trends and zone-level spending.
- Identify patterns consistent across games.
- Support marketing, staffing, and pricing optimization decisions.

## Data Sources
- Arena retail & F&B transaction logs (April 24, 26, May 1 2025)
- Store entries and customer ID datasets
- Arena pricing maps and store names

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning, merging, and consolidation across all event days.
2. Feature engineering for spend metrics, arrival density, and cross-game comparisons.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using heatmaps, distributions, and KPIs.
4. Visual synthesis in Python and Tableau.

## Key Deliverables
- **Executive Summary** – High-level findings and strategic insights.
- **PRD & Data Dictionary** – Complete documentation of datasets and features.
- **Visuals Folder** – Contains all PNG outputs from the EDA and dashboard.
